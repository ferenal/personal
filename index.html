      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <div>
        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          Chester Ferenal Rondina. And if you didn't noticed, each of my name
          has a length of seven leters, trivial thing I know.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now I am 22 years old, and it is also the last year of my
          university(if things go well).
        </p>
        <p>And, a lot of things happened, regrets even.</p>
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>
          I can play the guitar. But it doesn't mean that I know all of the
          chords. I'm at the point where I can kind of replicate any song just
          by ear. Still, you can tell by the sound of it that I am an amateur.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like cycling. And I used it to go to my university everyday(or every
          other day). Mind you that the distance to get there is 15km, and the
          travel time is around an hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a gamer. Kidding aside, even back when I was an elementary student
          I've always liked playing games. This might be one of the reasons why
          I picked this degree. Games I played this past few years are: League
          of Legends, Apex Legends, and Valorant. I've played some other games
          too but these 3 are the main ones. Note: i actually quit playing games
          now because it became an addiction and my gpu broke.
